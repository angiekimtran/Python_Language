# Practice program from Harvard's CS50P lecture 0 on Python function and variables

# Example 1
# Ask user for their name, remove whitespace from str, and capitalize user's name
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()

# Say hello to user
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Example 2
# Ask user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Remove whitespace from str and capitalize user's name
name = name.strip().title()

# Say hello to user
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
