# simple calculator with integers, input, and nested functions

# Practice 1
x = 1
y = 2

z = x + y

print(z)

# Practice 2 - input function and string to int data type conversion
x = input("What's x? ")
y = input("What's y? ")

z = int(x) + int(y)

print(z)

# Practice 3 - nested functions
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

print(x + y)
